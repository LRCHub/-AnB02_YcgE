Strange you took a lot of me
Today you took a lot of me

Someone was waiting
Falling slipping
Someone was waiting
Falling slipping

Wait
You're not the same at all
You're not the same same same same at all
Same same same same at all
Same same
Nowhere to leap
Coming back to me
Be gone to me
Falling back to me

Strange
You're not the same at all
You only running, running from the fire
And when you came you're shooting in it
You're never even going to say goodbye
You're never even going to say goodbye
You're only running from the fire

In the morning you'll be running from the fire
You're never even going to say goodbye
You're not the same at all
And when you get it you're shooting in it
You're never even going to say goodbye
