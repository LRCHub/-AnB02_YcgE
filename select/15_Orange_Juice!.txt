Oh, oh
Stick it down your throat
I'm watching from the bathroom
Making sure I don't choke, choke
From the words you spoke when you're screaming at the mirror
Now you're sitting in the cafeteria
Shoving clementines and orange back to your
Down your throat a dozen times, you're near, yeah
For another round of your bulimia

You turn oranges into orange juice
And do it, then spit it out of you
Your body is imperfectly perfect
Everyone wants what the other one's working
Orange juice

We cry O. J
We cry O. J
We cry O. J
We cry O. J

Oh, oh
I believe you chose
To blow it on the reading carpet
That's what happens when you're starvin'
Please say that it won't come to you
Ordering oranges off the menu
Stuffin' up your mouth like t-t-tissue
The way you look is not an issue

You turn oranges into orange juice
And do it, then spit it out of you
Your body is imperfectly perfect
Everyone wants what the other one's working
Orange juice

We cry O. J
We cry O. J
We cry O. J
We cry O. J

Ooh
I was about to give you my sad lies
Because I know your eyes ain't working, hmm-hmm
I wish I could tell you're fine, so fine
But you will find
That disconcerting

You turn oranges into orange juice
And do it, then spit it out of you
Your body is imperfectly perfect
Everyone wants what the other one's working
Orange juice

We cry O. J
We cry O. J
We cry O. J
We cry O. J

We cry O. J
We cry O. J
